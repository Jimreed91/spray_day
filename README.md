## General Information
- I spent some time helping to run an organic apple orchard a little while ago and wanted a way to make the job a little bit easier as it often involved doing several things at once including measuring things out precisely.
- Spray-day simplifies the process of setting up spray programs as once the details of the users farms and what products they want to be apply have been entered once, they are there ready to be selected again.
-Spray-day is mobile responsive and lets a job usually done at a desk be carried out anywhere while still providing records
- This project gave me a good opportunity to solidify my knowledge of Ruby on Rails and setting up a Postgres relational database and taught me how to deploy a rails app to a remote linux server (AWS EC2)
